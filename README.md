# SIMPLE WRAPPER!!!11

Read `run.sh` for how I ran it.

## Some Notes:

- You _might_ need to change some python library to include based on your current system. If you look on `c-python/Makefile`, my system uses python header on `/usr/include/python3.5m`. Make sure you include the correct python header directory (usually won't differ much, i.e still in `usr/include`).
